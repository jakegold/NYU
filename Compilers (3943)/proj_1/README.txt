Project 1
Individual project

This project is done in python
(built on a mac)

The tables are all hard coded into a file called tables.py
functions.py has all of the functions
main.py runs the program

to run the program run:

python main.py filename [filename...]

or

python main.py (input)

You will have to select which table to use at the command line

I have also attached some sample input and outputs (not a lot)
