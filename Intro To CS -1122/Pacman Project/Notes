For the class we needed to make a pacman AI
most of this code is not mine, it belongs to UC Berkley
I the file has info in it from berkley

I am not even sure that any of the code here is mine, it could be in a diff repository


the file was deleted because i realized that it could have had answers to the game that berkey set up...
